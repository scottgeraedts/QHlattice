Fixed coulomb energy.  The matrix elements in the
Landau basis are also now available.  (The lattice
compicatification is slighly different from the continuum
form, mostly in the m=0 pseudopontial)

Implemented self-tuning of mc acceptance ratio

Separated sampling code from metropolis code.
The coulomb, s(q), and strips are also separated
into independent code.

Initial equilibration is now monitored  with the |wf|**2 weight.

Fixed a bug when r4_uni returned 1 exactly  (it produces a
number in [0,1] with boundaries included).

The S(Q) printout now gives  s(q),  s_bar(q) and s0(q)
where s0(q) is the guiding-center structure factor, s_bar(q)
is s0(q) times the gaussiang form factor, and s(q) is the
"lowest-Landau-level" particle-coordinate form-factor.
