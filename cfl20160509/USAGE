compile mc_single.f90 with the other *.f90 codes in the main
directory.



Input:   (a sample input file is in the directory)

nel   m    
cosa aspect
seed
initial_step_cutoff equilibration_steps history
accept_reject_ratio
particle-moves-between_sampling
minimum_form_factor
n_units   n_steps



explanation:
NEL  is number of particles,   M  is Laughlin parameter (filling 1/m)

COSA is cosine of angle between pbc translations L1 and L2, ASPECT is |L2|/|L1|

SEED is a seed for the random numbers

use INITIAL_STEP_CUTOFFf = 0.8 or 0.9  (this is the lqrgest allowed quantum distance
(defined so d < 1) of one-particle steps used in   equilibration.   EQUILIBRATION_STEPS
should be about 1000.   (HISTORY = 50).   You will see the metropolis weight increase
rapidly as equilibration takes place.   The mean weight over the previous steps_history steps
and the maximum weight seen are also shown. 

ACCEPT_REJECT_RATIO    give 1 unless something else is wanted.   The system will self-tune
the step length to get the desired ratio.

PARTICLE_MOVES_BETWEEN_SAMPLING.   This is an attempt to make samples uncorrelated.
NEL/3 or seems adequate.


MINIMUM_FORM_FACTOR   (for S(Q))   for larger q where the form factor exp(|Q|^2\ell^2/2)
is too small, the results are just noise.   dont bother computing S(q) for q values with smaller form
factors than (say) 0.0001


N_UNITS   N_STEPS

the computation will be of N_UNITS  (bins), each  of N_STEPS  (really N_STEPS samples)
